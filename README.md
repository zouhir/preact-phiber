## Streamable Components using Phiber Minimal Pipes Algorithm

Preact Phiber allows you to render components in streamable chunks (like large JPEGs on a dial up connection) so that a component, its children, its aunts and uncles, its first, second & third (not fourth because minimal) cousins, and its maternal grandparents can load asynchronously. Our priority system (aka, family free favoritism) allows for full interactivity before the bundle even finishes loading.

## Who is using it?
The whole new Chime Beta: A 30KB alterative to Twitter with the same API is based on Phiber

## Preact Phiber ðŸŒ‹ Coming Soon
